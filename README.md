# X-auction

Welcome to the X-auction repo. This is a fictional e-auction application that's built using React, Vite, Node.JS (Several packages) and Bootstrap HTML/CSS. This project is meant to be an introduction to JSX (React) and several dependencies
to create a fully fleshed out fullstack auction website.
